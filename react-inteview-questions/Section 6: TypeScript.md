# Section 9: TypeScript

## 108. TypeScript Fundamentals
Expected Answer: Use TypeScript for static typing, better tooling, and early error detection. Hints:
•	Basic types: string, number, boolean, array, tuple, enum, any, unknown
•	type vs interface: interface for object shapes, type for unions
•	Generics for reusable type-safe components
•	Type inference reduces annotation needs

## 109. Advanced TypeScript Features
Expected Answer: Leverage advanced TypeScript features for robust type safety. Hints:
•	Utility types: Partial, Required, Pick, Omit, Record
•	Conditional types: T extends U ? X : Y
•	Mapped types for transforming object types
•	Type guards: typeof, instanceof, custom type predicates
•	keyof and indexed access types

## 110. TypeScript with React
Expected Answer: Type React components, hooks, props, and events properly. Hints:
•	Component props typing with interfaces
•	Event typing: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>
•	Hook typing: useState<Type>, useRef<Type>
•	Context typing with createContext<Type | undefined>
•	Generic components for reusability
